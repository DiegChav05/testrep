This repo contains all of the work done in a numerical analysis and computation class. Some topics include root finding (via Newton's method, bisection and several others), approximation methods, and matrix methods. The substructure has been set up so that there is a folder for labs and homeworks. There may also be work included from past computational classes such as Experimental and Computational methods, which have similar codes. The code that is in homeworks and labs is all written in Python3 and the remaining code was written in MatLab.
